# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to create AWS [`VPC Flow logs`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) backed by S3.

introduction: |-
  The module will create:

  * S3 bucket with server side encryption
  * KMS key to encrypt flow logs files in the bucket
  * Optional VPC Flow Log backed by the S3 bucket (this can be disabled, e.g. in multi-account environments if you want to create an S3 bucket in one account and VPC Flow Logs in different accounts)

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on Datadog), see [test](test).
